							***Objective of the game***

The objective of the game is to get a score equal or closer without exceeding 21 on your cards.

People who score closer to 21 without exceeding will be the winners of the round, receiving their bet plus an extra amount equal to the same bet.

The game does not have a limit of rounds if not until the player loses all his points or decides to withdraw from the game

If the dealer exceeds a score of 21 all players will win regardless of whether their cards exceed the value of 21
